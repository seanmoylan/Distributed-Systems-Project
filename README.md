# Distributed Systems Project
Sean Moylan - G00299424

As part of 4th Year Distributed Systems module I was asked to build a gRPC password service (Part 1) and an API Client that can create user accounts and user the password service to hash the user passwords and compare hashes

## Work Environment
- macOS Catalina
- Intellij IDEA
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io)
- [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com)

To run the PasswordService jar file, navigate to the directory `/Target` in the project folder
- run java -jar PasswordService.jar
- After that is run it should say server running on port 8080
- Server is now ready for client requests
